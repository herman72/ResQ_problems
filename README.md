## Automation Instructions

This section provides instructions on how to automate the execution of your Python script and refresh your Metabase dashboard.

### Automating Python Script Execution

To run your Python script periodically, you can use a cron job. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `crontab -e` to edit the cron table.
3. Add the following line to schedule your script to run at midnight (00:00) every day:

```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
```
Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the actual path to your Python script.

### Automating Dashboard Refresh in Metabase

To refresh your dashboard in Metabase, you can use the Auto-refresh feature. Follow the instructions provided in the Metabase documentation to set it up.
